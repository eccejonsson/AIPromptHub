# AI Prompt Repository

## Description

Welcome to the AI Prompt Repository, a curated collection of prompts designed to unlock the full potential of language models. Whether you're working with OpenAI's GPT models or exploring the capabilities of Midjourney, you'll find a variety of prompts to suit your needs. This project aims to provide a valuable resource for the AI community, focusing primarily on Natural Language Processing and other language model applications.

## Introduction

The AI Prompt Hub was created by me Ecce, to just keep a collection of prompts that I have curated or created over a span of time, that I feel are very useful.

## How to Use

1. **Browse Categories**: Navigate through the categories to find a prompt that suits your needs.
2. **Copy Prompt**: Copy the prompt you would like to use.
3. **Execute**: Use the copied prompt with your language model of choice.

## Sample Prompts

- **Data Science**: "Analyze the given dataset and provide insights."
- **Natural Language Processing**: "Summarize the following text into three sentences."
- **Conversational Agents**: "Hold a conversation as if you were a personal assistant."


### Resumes

- "Generate a summary for a software engineer resume."
- "List possible skills to include in a resume for a data scientist."
- "Create a cover letter introduction for a project manager position."

### MidJourney

- ```I'm going to train this chat to create detailed image prompts for an AI art generator called
MidJourney. Before we begin, I need to give you context about MidJourney. I'm first going
to explain what MidJourney is, then we'll break down the prompts.
Midjourney is an artificial intelligence program and service created and hosted by a San
Francisco-based independent research lab Midjourney, Inc. Midjourney generates images
from natural language descriptions, called "prompts", similar to OpenAI's DALL-E and
Stable Diffusion.
Midjourney is currently only accessible through a Discord bot on their official Discord
server, by direct messaging the bot, or by inviting the bot to a third party server. To
generate images, users use the /imagine command and type in a prompt; the bot then
returns a set of four images.
Midjourney is one of the most popular text-to-image AI services online. Users can use a
chat application, Discord, to communicate with the bot to create images. It uses simple
commands and requires no coding experience to create aesthetically pleasing images. Its
founder, David Holz, described Midjourney: “We just want it to be easy to use and we want
the pictures to look good.”
According to the company’s website, Midjourney is: “An independent research lab.
Exploring new mediums of thought. Expanding the imaginative powers of the human
species.” Similar to other AI models, it uses a vast amount of images to train on with the
power of machine learning. When provided with text input, its bots find pictures matching
the description and combine them artistically to create a unique image.
I need to give you info about the latest v5 Update.
What's new with the V5 base model?
- Much wider stylistic range and more responsive to prompting
- Much higher image quality (2x resolution increase) improved dynamic range
- More detailed images. Details more likely to be correct. Less unwanted text.
- Improved performance with image prompting
- Supports --tile argument for seamless tiling (experimental)
- Supports --ar aspect ratios greater than 2:1 (experimental)
- Supports --iw for weighing image prompts versus text prompts
Style and prompting for V5
- It’s MUCH more ‘unopinionated’ than v3 and v4, and is tuned to provide a wide diversity
of outputs and to be very responsive to your inputs.
- The tradeoff here is that it may be harder to use. Short prompts may not work as well.
You should try to write longer, more explicit text about what you want (ie: “cinematic photo
with dramatic lighting”)
- This model can generate much more realistic imagery than anything we've released
before.
V5 is our second model trained on our AI supercluster and has been in the works for 5
months. It uses significantly different neural architectures and new aesthetic techniques.
V5 isn't the final step, but we hope you all feel the progression of something deep and
unfathomable in the power of our collective human imagination.
Store this to reference to better understand what MidJourney is. Next I will explain the
prompt structure. Ready?```
- "Provide a list of recommended next steps based on the user's journey data."
- "Analyze the user's activity and suggest areas for improvement."

### Educational

- "Explain the concept of machine learning in simple terms."

- "Provide a step-by-step guide to solving quadratic equations."

### Coding

- "Explain the difference between a class and an object in Python."
- "Provide a JavaScript code snippet for a function that reverses a string."
- "List common use-cases for using Git in software development."

### Email

- "Draft an email to a client apologizing for a delayed project."
- "Compose a follow-up email after a job interview."
- "Write an email announcing a new product release to existing customers."
