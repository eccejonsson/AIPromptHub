## Description

Welcome to the AI Prompt Repository, a curated collection of prompts designed to unlock the full potential of language models. Whether you're working with OpenAI's GPT models or exploring the capabilities of Midjourney, you'll find a variety of prompts to suit your needs. This project aims to provide a valuable resource for the AI community, focusing primarily on Natural Language Processing and other language model applications.

## Introduction

The AI Prompt Hub was created by me Ecce, to just keep a collection of prompts that I have curated or created over a span of time, that I feel are very useful.

## How to Use

1. **Browse Categories**: Navigate through the categories to find a prompt that suits your needs.
2. **Copy Prompt**: Copy the prompt you would like to use.
3. **Execute**: Use the copied prompt with your language model of choice.

## Categories

- [Resumes](#resumes)
- [MidJourney](#midjourney)
- [Educational](#educational)
- [Coding](#coding)
- [Email](#email)

## Sample Prompts

- **Data Science**: "Analyze the given dataset and provide insights."
- **Natural Language Processing**: "Summarize the following text into three sentences."
- **Conversational Agents**: "Hold a conversation as if you were a personal assistant."


## Resumes

```text
Assume the persona of a career consultant specializing in placing candidates in top-tier organizations. Utilize insights gleaned from their professional history to offer strategic guidance on the actions they should undertake to secure their desired position
```
```text
Intent on securing a role as [insert job] at [company name], I present the following excerpt from the job listing:

[insert job posting]

First, distill the essential qualifications and experiences enumerated in this posting, prioritizing them based on your consultancy expertise. Subsequently, invite the client to share their relevant professional background for tailored guidance moving forward.
```

```text
Analyze the client's provided work experiences, which are as follows:


[INSERT WORK EXPERIENCE HERE]

Isolate the key elements that align closely with the job requirements. Furnish the client with a synthesized list of these pertinent experiences. Concurrently, compile a separate list detailing the experiential gaps the client has in relation to the job posting.
```

After this, you can ask for things like:

1. "What are the must-have skills for a software engineer's resume?"
2. "How should I format my CV for a UX Designer role?"
3. "Generate a compelling opening paragraph for a cover letter aiming for a Business Analyst position."
4. "What are common interview questions for a DevOps Engineer?"
5. "List certifications that would make my profile stand out for a Cybersecurity Specialist role."
6. "What action verbs should I include in my resume for a Product Manager position?"
7. "Suggest a career progression path for someone starting as a Junior Data Scientist."
8. "How can I tailor my LinkedIn profile for a career in Artificial Intelligence?"
9. "Recommend networking strategies for breaking into the FinTech industry."
10. "Provide tips for negotiating a higher salary for a Senior Developer role."
11. "What are key performance indicators that HR Managers look for during performance reviews?"
12. "List the types of projects that I should include in my portfolio for a Front-End Developer role."
13. "Generate a closing paragraph for a thank-you email after an interview for a Marketing Manager position."
14. "What are soft skills that are often overlooked but crucial for a Team Leader?"
15. "Suggest courses or workshops to improve my skill set for a Machine Learning Engineer position."

### Part 1: Introduction and Context on MidJourney
MidJourney is an AI service based in San Francisco that converts text prompts into images. The V5 update improves image quality and introduces new features like seamless tiling and varied aspect ratios.

---

### Part 2: Updated Prompt Structure
The V5 update allows for more nuanced and descriptive prompts, including style, camera settings, and artistic influences. Parameters like `--ar` can be added for specific aspect ratios.

---

### Part 3: Examples of More Advanced Prompts
Examples include:
- "A serene landscape at twilight, infused with the mystique of Salvador Dalí --ar 16:9"
- "A bustling cyberpunk cityscape under a neon-lit sky --ar 4:3"

---

### Part 4: Prompt Categories Table
A table with categories can guide prompt construction. Categories include Composition, Camera Angle, Style, Subject/Focal Point, etc.

---

### Part 5: Usage
After choosing a row from the table, a specific MidJourney prompt will be crafted based on the categories, along with the desired aspect ratio.

---

### Part 6: Training Steps from User
1. **Act as a Photographer**: Understand the subject and context for which you're crafting the prompt. For example, consider elements like lighting, angles, and focus while conceptualizing the image.
   
2. **Table Categories**: Create a table breaking down the composition into specific categories such as Composition, Camera angle, Style, etc., to have a structured approach for creating prompts.

3. **Brief Prompts**: Keep the prompts concise yet descriptive enough to convey the intended message or image.

4. **User Choices**: Generate multiple rows based on the table categories and allow the user to pick one. The chosen row will act as the foundation for creating a specific, nuanced prompt.

5. **Specialize for Different Subjects**: If the subject of the prompt is specialized, like food photography, adjust the table categories to reflect that. For example, include columns like "camera equipment" and "lens."
